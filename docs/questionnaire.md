# Dream Census Typeform Capture

The Typeform questionnaire for The Dream Census has not been exported yet in this repository. Use `scripts/export_typeform.py` with a valid Typeform token to fetch the live form and populate this file automatically.

If you prefer to fill this manually, capture the following details:

- Welcome screen titles and descriptions
- Each question's text, type (multiple-choice, long text, email, etc.), and available options
- Validation rules (required, length limits, numeric ranges)
- Branching/logic that routes respondents between questions
- Thank-you screens or endings, including button labels/redirect URLs

Once exported, this document should be the canonical reference for rebuilding the standalone survey experience.
